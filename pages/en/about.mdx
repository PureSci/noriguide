# About Nori

Nori started as a simple reminder bot that my friend and I used to help us drop cards in Sofi. As I continued playing Sofi, I came up with the idea of creating a bot that would assist players in deciding which cards to grab. I got to work and soon made it available to the public.

Despite facing challenges, including Nori being rejected twice by Discord, I didn't give up. I persevered through the setbacks, working tirelessly to make Nori functional. Ultimately, my efforts paid off.

Nori became the first bot to offer "Drop Analysis" and is currently the fastest among its competitors.

I hope you enjoy Nori.
